# [Original Repo florinpop17/app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas)

This repository has been modified by me to include tier 4 projects, it's for cloning from other apps/websites from well-known companies.

These applications are:

- great for improving your coding skills :muscle:;
- great for experimenting with new technologies ðŸ†•;
- great for adding to your portfolio to impress your next employer/client :file_folder:;
- great for using as examples in tutorials (articles or videos) :page_with_curl:;
- easy to complete and also easily extendable with new features :ok_hand:;

This is not just a simple list of projects, but a collection that describes each project in enough detail so that you can develop it from the ground up!

Each project has the following **features**:

1. A clear and descriptive objective;
2. A list of _Main Features_ which should be implemented (these stories act more as a guideline than a forced list of _To-Do's_. Feel free to add your own features if you want);
3. A list of bonus features that not only improve the base project, but also your skills at the same time (these are optional and should be attempted only after you have completed the required main features)
4. All the resources and links to help you find what you need to complete the project
